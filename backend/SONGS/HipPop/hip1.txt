Song Title: "Rise Up"
(Verse 1)
I'm a fighter, born to conquer
In the streets where dreams are torn asunder
From the ashes, I'll rise higher
Defying odds, setting the city on fire

(Chorus)
Rise up, stand tall, we won't fall
We're the voices of the unheard, breaking down walls
In this concrete jungle, we'll make our mark
Hip-hop's the fuel, igniting the spark
