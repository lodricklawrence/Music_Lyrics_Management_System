Song Title: "City Streets"
(Verse 1)
Welcome to the city streets, where dreams collide
Concrete jungles, where the strong survive
Hustlers on the corner, chasing that paper
From the struggle to the top, no one can cap our flavor

(Chorus)
City streets, where the beats never sleep
From the hood to the club, it's a rhythm we keep
We spit fire on the mic, taking it to new heights
In the city streets, we own the nights
