Song Title: "Revolution"
(Verse 1)
This is the revolution, a lyrical revelation
Spreading truth, sparking minds with elevation
We rise against the system, fighting for change
Through the power of hip-hop, we rearrange

(Chorus)
Revolution, it's time to take a stand
Breaking the chains, demanding justice in this land
We won't be silenced, we won't be denied
Through our rhymes, the revolution will rise
