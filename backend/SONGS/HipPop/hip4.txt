Song Title: "Mind's Canvas"
(Verse 1)
My mind's a canvas, where I paint my thoughts
Using words and beats, expressing what can't be bought
Through the rhythm and flow, I create my art
Crafting stories and emotions, straight from the heart

(Chorus)
My mind's canvas, where creativity flows
In this hip-hop world, my true self shows
I spit the verses, like brushstrokes on a wall
My lyrics paint a picture, capturing it all
