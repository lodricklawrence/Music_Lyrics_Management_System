Song Title: "Legacy"
(Verse 1)
I'm building my legacy, a story to be told
Leaving my mark in this game, worth more than gold
From the struggle to the top, I'll pave the way
Hip-hop's my platform, where I make my stay

(Chorus)
Legacy, the imprint that I'll leave behind
Through my words and rhymes, forever I'll shine
I'll inspire the generations, break the mold
Building a legacy that can't be sold
